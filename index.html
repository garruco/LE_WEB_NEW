            >One of the best-known names in graphic design, the Dutch modernist
            master and teacher reflects on his work and career to date.</span
          ><br />
          He may be 81 years old, with a career spanning 60 years and counting,
          but Karel Martens is still of the mindset that his work can always be
          better. It's what drives the self-professed workaholic, he tells us
          over a video call, and it's the reason he's updated his historic
          monograph several times.<br /><br />
          Originally published back in 1996, the monograph was an instant
          classic in its extensive survey of the prolific graphic designer's
          career. As well as co-founding the two-year master's programme at
          Werkplaats Typografie, with Wigger Bierma in Arnhem, Karel, a central
          figure in the Dutch modernist movement, seems to have designed it all.
          Throughout his impressive career he has turned his hand to stamps,
          coins and films - not to mention every other graphic design staple,
          from books to corporate identities.

            Flicking through his monographs provides a tireless flow of
            inspiration, including most recently the one published on the cusp
            of 2020 by Roma Publications. Featuring an open Japanese bind and
            double-sheeted spreads, this most recent monograph is different to
            its predecessors for its play with borders, as Karel puts it, an
            interesting area “where two worlds meet”.<br /><br />

            comprehensive spread, Re-Printed Matter remains resolute in its
            detail and beauty. It's also a testament to Karel Martens'
            unyielding and ever-curious approach to creativity.

          <div class="text2-2-1">
            Karel could have easily developed an ego, so it's refreshing to hear
            someone of his stature freely admit that “sometimes you still make
            the same old stupid mistakes. ” It's this criticality that drives
            him to keep making work, but that also on the flip side prevents him
            from looking back at old projects with nostalgia. For him, mistakes
            give rise to unexpected surprises, especially those made on the
            computer, a technology established decades into his career. “It can
            be a nice surprise or not so nice a surprise”, he says, “but by
            making mistakes, sometimes you feel like, wow, where did that come
            from?”

          There is nothing negative associated with the mistake for Karel. It
          may be a cliché, but the proof is in the pudding. He's someone who
          views no difference between artist and designer (just the label) and
          through his unique way of seeing, creativity is<br /><br />

          Making work is “all about trying and discovering” and in his opinion,
          “there are no truths”. He uses the example of a garden. When creating
          a garden, the common law dictates that the big plants go at the end
          and the small ones in front. <br /><br /><span class="hovered"
            >But what if the other way around is more interesting?</span
          ><br /><br />
          Famous for his sense of experimentation, there are countless projects
          we could cite now to demonstrate the Dutch master's way of
          thinking.We'll just mention a few that helped cement his reputation
          for type and print: the design of OASE Journal for Architecture, where
          Karel explores the relationship between graphic design and
          architecture, a role he took up in 1990; his well-known symbol
          generated cloud images, formed by the tight repetition of intricately
          designed rosettes; and perhaps most infamously, his ongoing work with
          the Stedelijk's print collection where he repurposes old archive cards
          to become diplomas for Werkplaats Typografie graduates.

          The list of Karel’s defining projects could go on for a while, and
          after all, it’s why the monogram exists in multiple iterations. But
          it’s his lesser-known works that are potentially the most interesting,
          as they show a different side to the accomplished designer. His
          experimental film Not For Resale, for instance, shows exactly how a
          blunder can propel one's creativity forward. The conversation around
          the film began as we discussed the development of technology.

        </div>
        To process this, he made a movie, a way for him to do something with the
        experience. At the time, he was working on a university lecture and as
        he always does, he pinned reference images on the wall as an “extension
        of memory”, an archive of sorts.<br />
        <br />Karel’s daughter – who incidentally is also a graphic designer –
        took pictures of the wall, every ten centimetres to make into
        presentation slides. And after the lecture, a pupil asked to have a copy
        of the slides, which for Karel, meant using a scanner for the first
        time.<br /><br />
        he says. When those first attempts at scans landed on Karel’s computer’s
        desktop, it was “a mess” – as he puts it,<br /><br />
        With help from a technician at the computer lab, hundreds of Karel’s
        scans suddenly came to life as they were organised in a folder.<br /><br />
        he thought, as he imagined the scans as frames, edited together in an
        ordered sequence.

            Teaching is “a kind of broad way of gaining information,” he says,
            explaining that learning is a two-way street between pupil and
            professor. Every autumn (with the exception of 2020, given the
            pandemic), Karel usually journeys to New York to lecture at Yale
            School of Art. He notes the multiculturalism of the student
            population - people from all over the world, from differing cultures
            and backgrounds too. And when such a wide-ranging group gathers
            together in one place, “you can learn a lot.”It goes back to his
            quintessential view that curiosity is key, as now, for a man who has
            done so many wonderful things and inspired so many people, he

                      About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for

                  I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — it has no
                  pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set
                  each one of the 79 pieces in a different typeface. I loved
                  this idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with it.

                  <span class="italic">"Would we set it in ITC Garamond?"</span>
                  He looked at meas if I was crazy.
                  <span class="italic">"Of course,"</span> he said.
